# TODO

- Display "Today" instead of "Next: (next week)" for
  shows airing on the current day. For shows on break
  returning this day next week, keep them faded out.

- Calculate the weekday if there's an airdate for
  the next episode, but the schedule is missing.

- Refresh in-place after editing instead of actually
  reloading the page, so the expanded day is preserved.

- Implement a UI for the addshow API.

- Move link patterns into the db instead of hardcoding.

- Add epguides.com links? (How to find?)

- jQuery is only used for slideUp/slideDown. Overkill?
