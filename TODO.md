# TODO

- Display "Today" instead of "Next: (next week)" for
  shows airing on the current day (or yesterday if
  showing that because it's too early today).

- For shows on break returning this day next week, keep
  them faded out. Requires getting previous episode date
  from TVMaze.

- Calculate the weekday if there's an airdate for
  the next episode, but the schedule is missing.

- Implement a UI for the addshow API.

- Move link patterns into the db instead of hardcoding.

- Add epguides.com links? (How to find?)

- jQuery is only used for slideUp/slideDown. Overkill?
