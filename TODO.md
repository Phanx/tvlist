# TODO

- Show days to next episode? Hide next episode if more
  than 30 days away?

- Move next airdate detection into main routine so
  it only has to be calculated once.

- Prune unused parts from fetched data?

- Maybe: Store all the data, keep track of the last
  fetched date, and refresh every 24 hours.
